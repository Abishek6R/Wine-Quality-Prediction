# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Prediction of the Quality of Wine using Red and White wine Data using R Program

This project aims to predict wine quality using multiple linear regression. The dataset used contains various attributes of wine, such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content, along with quality ratings. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts wine quality based on these attributes.

Data Exploration: Utilized R programming to explore the dataset, identifying patterns and relationships between different wine attributes.
Preprocessing: Handled outliers and multicollinearity to ensure data integrity and improve model performance.
Model Building: Constructed a multiple linear regression model to predict wine quality based on selected attributes.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric.
